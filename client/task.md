Clicking on "View Performance" button on /student-details page does not show the "+" button and as 
there is no data initially, it should show an empty table but it does not show that also. It only show this:
Performance
Courses
Algorithm
Discrete Mathematics
Database
Performances

Why is that? fix it.
